Model Introduction
===================
We have implemented 17 false information recognition algorithm models, including content-based false information
recognition algorithms, social background based false information recognition algorithms, and knowledge perception based
false information recognition algorithms.

Content based
--------------
The content-based false information recognition algorithm utilizes textual and visual information in news content to
detect false news.

Social context
---------------
The false information recognition algorithm based on social background detects and distinguishes false news by
investigating social background information related to news articles, especially through dissemination on social media.
